## Endpoints
Get latest launch
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches/latest
```

Get next launch
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches/next
```

Get all past launches
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches
```

Get all upcoming launches
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches/upcoming
```

Get all upcoming and past launches
```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches/all
```

All launches can be filtered though any combination of the following query strings

```http
GET https://api.spacexdata.com/v2/launches?launch_year=2017&rocket_id=falcon9&core_reuse=true&core_serial=B1029
```

## Querystring Response Notes
* By default, the `/launches` endpoint returns an array of JSON objects when queried
* `/launches/next` and `/launches/latest` returns one object instead of an array, since only one launch is possible for those endpoints
* If no match is found when using querystring filtering, an empty array is returned `[]` with a 200 response code

  "details": "Part of the Explorers program, this space telescope is intended for wide-field search of exoplanets transiting nearby stars. It is the first NASA high priority science mission launched by SpaceX. It was the first time SpaceX launched a scientific satellite not primarily intended for Earth observations. The second stage placed it into a high-Earth elliptical orbit, after which the satellite's own booster will perform complex maneuvers including a lunar flyby, and over the course of two months, reach a stable, 2:1 resonant orbit with the Moon. In January 2018, SpaceX received NASA's Launch Services Program Category 2 certification of its Falcon 9 'Full Thrust', certification which is required for launching medium risk missions like TESS. It was the last launch of a new Block 4 booster, and marked the 24th successful recovery of the booster. An experimental water landing was performed in order to attempt fairing recovery."
